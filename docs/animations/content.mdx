## Customization [sr-only]
<Overview />

Master CSS keyframes work by parsing animation-related syntax and generating only the keyframe CSS rules used into a CSS file or running stylesheet.

This means that even thousands of pre-defined keyframes are not included in the final stylesheet like traditional CSS Ôºç **it's generated on demand.**

## Default
To preview the actual effect of all keyframes, see the [animation](/docs/animation) documentation:

## Future

- The preset package `@master/animate.css` for [animate.style](https://animate.style) [#129](https://github.com/master-co/css/issues/219)
